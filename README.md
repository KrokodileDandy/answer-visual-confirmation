This is a very simple Anki Addon that provides a visual confirmation of your Answer in the reviewer by displaying either a thumbs up or a thumbs down picture depending on your answer to the card. it's function is very similar to the [Visual Feedback for Reviews](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1749604199) addon but it allows using animated gifs for more fun and it works with Anki 2.1


## Configuration
From the menu bar > tools > add-ons
choose "Answer Visual Confirmation" then > Configuration

the default configuration are: <br>
`
{  "duration": 700,  "theme": "still" }
`
<br>
you can change the `duration` of which the visual confirmation appears (in ms) or the set of images to appear through the value of the `theme`<br>
available `theme` options are: `still` and `animated`

#### More customization
If you don't like either of the themes you can add your own images :<br>
Head to the addon folder and replace both `heartbreak.png` and `like.png`
or both `thumbsUp.gif` and `thumbsDown.gif`
with your own images.<br>
<b>make sure your images dimensions are 256x256 </b>
